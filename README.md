# fog-of-war
I've been designing a F2P PVP strategy/stealth iOS game and mocking it up in Unity! It's a base-builder with asynchronous PVP attack and defense gameplay- CLASH OF CLANS meets METAL GEAR SOLID. This repository is a GitHub Pages site hosting my latest build at http://calebstrait.github.io/fog-of-war/

You are the commander of an elite team of soldiers tasked with constructing and defending a key communications outpost in the center of a dense, foggy forest! 

DEFEND - Deploy snipers, barricades, traps, cameras and more! Design patrol routes and dynamic tactical responses to enemy attacks with programmable AI!

ATTACK - Plan and execute stealth raids on enemy outposts! Disable traps and disrupt enemy communications to extract munitions and key intel!
